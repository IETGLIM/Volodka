# Volodka RPG — Improvement Session Worklog

## Session: 2025-07-17 — Comprehensive Graphics, Physics, Gameplay Overhaul

### Context
User (IT engineer, health issues, making game for family) requested comprehensive improvements
after 2 months of stalled gameplay progress. The game is a 3D RPG inspired by Disco Elysium,
built with Vite + React 19 + Three.js 0.172 + R3F 9.6 + Rapier Physics + Zustand.

### Constraints
- DO NOT modify poems (poems.ts) or menu components
- Everything else is open to improvement

---

## Commit 1: `3555ff76` — Cinematic Graphics, Physics Feel, Critical Gameplay Fixes

### Critical Fixes
- **Cinematic Timeline Orphan Watchdog**: Auto-stops stuck timelines after totalDuration + 15s.
  Previously, if the R3F component unmounted mid-cutscene, `activeTimelineId` stayed set
  forever, permanently blocking ALL new cutscenes AND scene transitions.
- **Interaction FSM Stuck-State Auto-Recovery**: 15s timeout auto-resets stuck
  Approach/Cutscene/Align/Lock/Dialogue states with dev warning + event emission.

### Post-Processing (ExplorationPostFX.tsx)
- volodka_room bloom: 0.68→0.78, threshold 0.52→0.45 (more monitor glow bleed)
- Color grading: contrast +0.06, hue -0.02 (tealer), saturation +0.03
- Added film grain (Noise effect) for indoor scenes at high quality (opacity 0.035)
- Vignette: 0.38→0.42 (more claustrophobic)
- street_night, cafe_evening, sleep_dream, battle also tuned

### Camera (applyCameraFrame.ts, cinematicCamera.ts, cameraConstants.ts)
- Walking head bob: 12mm amplitude, 10 rad/s, speed-blended intensity
- Spring damping: 0.85→0.92 (more cinematic weight, less oscillation)
- Spring stiffness: 16→14 (smoother follow with subtle delay)
- Look-ahead: strength 0.15→0.20, lerp speed 3.0→3.8
- Turn tilt: max 0.025→0.02 rad

### Scene Lighting (volodka_room)
- 4th light: cold blue rim light (moonlight through curtain)
- Monitor glow: cold_pulse animation, brighter
- Bedside lamp: candle_flicker animation
- Under-desk warm glow + floor cold bounce lights
- Ambient darkened (0.62→0.55) for dramatic contrast
- 400 dust particles (was 300), warmer amber, larger size range

### Exploration & Interaction
- God ray: taller (2.4→2.8m), wider cone, brighter flash, faster pulse
- NPC range: 3.0→3.5m, zone padding: 1.35→1.55m
- Interaction highlight: brighter glow (0.45→0.52)
- Proximity light reactivity: 15% faster
- Glitch effects trigger earlier (80%→70% of radius)

## Commit 2: `cf4e3c37` — Cinematic Cutscenes, Dialogue Camera, NPC Approach, Story Guidance

### Cutscene Fixes
- Fixed intro wake-up settle phase bug (0.01s snap → proper 1.8s)
- Slowed intro pacing: terminal 3.5→4.2s, rise 3.5→3.8s, standing 2.0→2.5s
- Clamped timeline localT to [0,1] for smooth phase boundaries
- Scene transitions: easeInOutCubic → easeInOutQuart (cinematic lift-off/settle)

### Dialogue Camera
- Randomized shot switch interval (3.2-4.0s) for natural rhythm
- Smooth shot blending via easeInOutCubic (position, lookAt, FOV)
- Softer dialogue spring (stiffness 14→8, damping 0.92→0.88)
- New SpringOverride type threaded through camera pipeline

### NPC Interaction
- Adaptive approach speed: 3.8 m/s far → smoothstep deceleration to 1.2 m/s near
- No more abrupt stops — natural ease-out curve

### Story Guidance
- Tiered player-lost timeouts: Act 1=15s, Act 2=20s, Acts 3-7=25s
- Fixed 3s check interval

### Accessibility
- Cinematic dialogue choices respect reducedMotion

## Commit 3: `3e18a506` — Scene Atmospheres, Player Physics, Landing/Jump/Wall Feedback

### Scene Lighting (All Key Scenes)
- volodka_corridor: dramatic warm/cold contrast, flickering overhead, deeper shadows
- street_night: warm overhead for readability, darker ambient for neon contrast
- home_evening: 3rd warm fill light, warmer tones
- cafe_evening: 4th blue neon back-light, warm-cold contrast

### New Accent Lights (5 Scenes)
- volodka_corridor: flickering + cold blue ends
- cafe_evening: blue cold_pulse + warm orange
- office_day: fluorescent cold_pulse + cold fills
- library_day: warm banker's lamp glow
- park_day: dappled sunlight at varying heights

### Player Physics
- Landing camera shake (proportional to impact velocity)
- Variable jump height (tap = short hop, hold = full height, 2.8x gravity on release)
- Running FOV boost (+3° at full sprint, smoothly interpolated)
- Wall bump micro-shake (0.012 intensity, 0.3s cooldown)

### Post-Processing Refinements
- Corridor: deeper contrast, heavier vignette
- Home: warmer hue, richer saturation
- Cafe: reduced contrast for hazy atmosphere

## Commit 4: `0890ac25` — Ambient Occlusion, Narrative Polish, Interaction Feedback

### Ambient Occlusion (10 More Scenes)
- volodka_corridor, abandoned_factory, factory_basement, zarema_albert_room, solnysh_room
- 5 new visual profiles for extension scenes
- Default AO radius +12.5%, hero +14.6%

### Adaptive Quality
- Degradation requires 15s sustained low FPS (was 10s)
- Strike reset: 5s (was 3s)

### Narrative Presentation
- AnimatePresence mode='wait' for proper crossfade
- Keyed by nodeId for content transitions
- Breathing glow on diegetic dialogue border
- Skill check failure reasons in Russian with Lock icon
- Quest completion: gold flash; objective: green pulse

### Interaction Feedback
- Act-gate failure: shake + amber flash
- Zone unavailable: stronger shake + rose flash
- One-time used: shake + gray flash
- Skill check fail: strongest shake + brightest flash

### Story Guidance
- Rolling window hint picker (no repeat hints)
